## Project Setup
Before we jump into the code we need to make sure your project is properly configured to use the QuantumPay frameworks. Follow the steps below to get you set up.

### Adding the QuantumPay SDKs

1. Open Visual Studio and create a new folder to put the frameworks in. If you have a place for frameworks already you can skip this.

2. Import the QuantumPay frameworks into your folder.

### Add MFi protocols to Info.plist
Go to your project's **Info.plist** file and add a new entry for "Supported external accessory protocols" using the following values. Note: in Xcode 13.0+ this has been moved to the "Info" tab in your project's settings.

```
com.datecs.pengine
com.datecs.linea.pro.msr
com.datecs.linea.pro.bar
com.datecs.printer.escpos
com.datecs.iserial.communication
com.datecs.printer.label.zpl
com.datecs.label.zpl
com.datecs.pinpad

```

### Add Privacy entries to Info.plist

Also in your project's **Info.plist** file we need to add the four (4) privacy tags listed below. You can enter any string value you want or copy what we have below. Note: in Xcode 13.0+ this has been moved to the "Info" tab in your project's settings.

```
"Privacy - Bluetooth Always Usage Description" 
"Privacy - Bluetooth Peripheral Usage Description"
"Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description" 
"Privacy - Location Usage Description"
```
